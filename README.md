# Solar Radiation Data Analysis

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on solar radiation data collected from multiple countries in West Africa: **Benin**, **Togo**, and **Sierra Leone**. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize solar radiation patterns across these countries and explore various insights related to the data.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Understand the distribution and trends of solar radiation across different regions.
- Identify seasonal and geographical patterns in solar radiation data.
- Provide insights into potential applications for solar energy deployment in West Africa.
  
## Features
- **Multiple Country Analysis**: Data from **Benin**, **Togo**, and **Sierra Leone** are included, providing a comparative analysis.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Create visualizations to understand solar radiation patterns, trends, and correlations.
- **Statistical Summary**: The application provides descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for solar radiation data.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualization of solar radiation data on maps to understand regional patterns and variations.
- **Trend Analysis**: Examining time series data to observe seasonal variations and other temporal patterns in solar radiation.

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Plotly (optional)**: For interactive visualizations and charts.

## Dataset
The dataset contains solar radiation data collected from stations located across **Benin**, **Togo**, and **Sierra Leone**. The data includes information such as:
- Date and time of observation.
- Solar radiation values (in W/mÂ² or other units).
- Location details (latitude, longitude, region).
